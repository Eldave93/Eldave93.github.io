I am a motivated and sociable data scientist, educator, and coach. I am passionate about the practical applications of data science and machine learning, with an aim to educate and inspire others to use these skills to tackle real-world challenges. I have been a coach to a range of individuals (career starters to Vice Presidents and Directors), from some of the world’s best companies, to support them becoming high-performing analysts and data science professionals.

I have experience organizing and delivering undergraduate and master’s university courses that covered topics such as data science, machine learning, analyzing and interpreting data, and research design. I also successfully obtained multiple funding grants (Google, MRC, NIHR, and the EPSRC) to develop world-class automatic seizure detection models and a portable bio-sensing platform, and conducted other applied machine learning and neuroscience research.
