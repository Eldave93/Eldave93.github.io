> "David,
>
> Just wanted to drop you a big thank you for your effort over the past few weeks with the course.
> 
> Iâ€™ve gone from being really cloudy with Python to feeling really confident in diving in, to the point Iâ€™m now happily plagiarising your workbook! â˜ ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘½
>
> Itâ€™s been so useful, and if Iâ€™m honest has opened my eyes up to Data Science as a profession.
>
> I believe in always trying to be appreciative of people who make a difference, and I truly want to thank you for listening to my comments, the difference in approach has really worked wonders for me. Iâ€™d love to be able to discuss this with anyone in Multiverse if its possible, or alternatively please feel free to share this e-mail with your peers.
>
> I started this course with the aim of underpinning my skills, but now Iâ€™m realising that it is really going to open the door to pursuing the thing I love seriously as a career. For that I am most grateful."
